<p>Solving REAL problems!</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaey took birth when 300+ working women shared they had a problem finding the best fitting classiest work-wear in India! A shocking 69% of them said that currently, the Indian apparel market does not have good enough work-wear choices. Most women complained about sizing being one of the biggest problems. They felt that clothes are not made to fit Indian bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tech-enabled SizeYOU</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re unique, and so is your body! Why should you be tagged by letters or numbers? Hence we ditched standard sizes altogether, and came up with just one SizeYOU – your body, your size! We’re proudly the first brand in India using an AI-enabled Virtual Tailor to capture 70+ measurements using 2 photos, to get you the best fit made for YOU!</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-imagining Work-wear</p>

</ul>
<p>Epitome of Convenience</p>

</ul>
<p>Customizable Luxury</p>
<ul>
