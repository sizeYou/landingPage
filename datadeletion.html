                    <p><strong>1. Purpose</strong></p>
                    <p>This document sets out our policy for responding to data deletion requests under data protection laws. This document explains the data subject&#39;s rights regarding data deletion and the responsibilities of Jaey in responding to such a request.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Individual Rights</strong></p>
                    <p>An individual has the right to erasure, also known as &#39;the right to be forgotten&#39;. The principle underpinning this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. When does the right to erasure apply?</strong></p>
                    <p>Individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary about the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;</li>
                    <li>When the individual withdraws consent;</li>
                    <li>When the individual objects to the processing and there is no other legal ground for the relevant processing activity;</li>
                    <li>When the personal data was unlawfully processed;</li>
                    <li>Where the personal data has to be erased to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>4. What information does Jaey retain?</strong></p>
                    <p>Jaey stores data about individuals to create an account for our customers on our platform to enable them to subscribe for updates or place an order. We store the first name, last name, phone number, e-mail address, billing address, delivery address, profession, language, city, entity, height, weight, age, gender, and body type through variations as chosen by the user, various user body measurements points captured through our Virtual Tailor technology, user clothing sizes in isolation or in comparison with other brands, user preferences with respect to customization and other details of their orders, user reviews with or without media, which is stored on our secure servers for a period of use of this account in our platform. Some of the above data points are optional for the user to provide, so if they choose not to provide that data, it is not stored with us. This data is stored and used by our Privacy Policy, which can be found at: <a href="https://jaey.in/privacy.html">Privacy Policy Link</a></p>
                    <p>If consent is provided, personal data may be stored in our CRM system to contact you regarding Jaey news, products, and promotions.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. How can data be deleted?</strong></p>
                    <p>If you have subscribed to Jaey or made a purchase through Jaey, Jaey acts as a data controller. In this case, we will delete the user account upon request (via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@jaey.in">privacy@jaey.in</a>). All your data will be deleted upon closure of your account, or after three years from that, based on the purpose of the erasure request and requirement of the data for Jaey. In any case, if the user withdraws consent for Jaey to save their data, we will perform immediate data deletion to that effect.</p>
                    <p>Data may remain in the system&#39;s backup files, which will be deleted periodically.</p>
                    <p>Information may be deleted from our CRM upon request to privacy@jaey.in. We undertake to perform the deletion within one month (30 calendar days) and will send you a confirmation once the information has been deleted. Wherever possible, we will aim to complete the request in advance of the deadline.</p>
